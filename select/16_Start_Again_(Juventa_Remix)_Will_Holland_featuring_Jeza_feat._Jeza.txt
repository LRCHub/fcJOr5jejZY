Never knew how much it mattered to you
I'm losing sight of the things that I'd set out to do
Looking at the sky
Never knew that I could fly
Afraid to start again
Push, pushing myself down
Into this hole that comforts me to stay
And I try
To stay awake
Because every night it always feels too late
Never tried to
Never knew you
Never knew just how to fly
Always failed you
Never came through
Never saw the other side
Looking at the sky
Never knew that I could fly
Afraid to start again
And I don't know why
I was so afraid to fly
Why would happen if I tried
I'd have to start again
You're faster
Slow down
I can't catch up
I'm losing ground
Looking at the sky
Never knew that I could fly
Afraid to start again
And I don't know why
You are so afraid to fly
What would happen if we tried
We'd have to start again
